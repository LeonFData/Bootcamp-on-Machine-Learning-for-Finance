[The Bootcamp](http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/activities/19-20/bootcamp_ML_F) focused on training graduate students and financial practitioners in state-of-the-art data analytics techniques. This edition of the event will focus on advanced machine learning techniques currently being used in the financial industry, as well as novel techniques at the forefront of academic research. Topics include unsupervised and supervised machine learning, data mining and applications in predictive and risk analytics, fraud detection and consumer finance, convolution neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and deep reinforcement learning, image recognition, high-frequency models of financial markets, and credit risk analytics.

As with many other businesses, virtually all aspects of banking and finance now incorporate some elements of statistical learning coupled with large datasets, otherwise known as machine learning. This boot camp, delivered by 4 experienced and internationally recognized instructors, is intended to provide students and practitioners with a solid grasp of the foundations of the topic and quickly bring them to the exciting frontiers of the subject.
